    "### What is Text Analysis?\n",
    "Text analysis (also called Text mining) is the use of large datasets of text to do pattern analysis.  While the analysis of patterns in text is not new, more recent technologies make the processing of large datasets easier. The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) allows users to do textual analysis on collections in the HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL). I hope by the end of the session, you will know where to start if you are interested in learning how to do textual analysis with HTRC.\n",
